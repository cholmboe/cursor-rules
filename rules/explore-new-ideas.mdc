# Idea exploration and planning process

This rule applies to the phases of ideation, planning, and documentation. It should not be used during coding. Under no circumstances should we proceed to implement the idea without my explicit request. Follow this process sequentially and as directed in the steps.

## Step 1 - Explore my idea

Ask me one question at a time to fully understand my idea. Each question should build on my previous answers, starting with broad concepts and moving to specific details. Regularly confirm your understanding and avoid making assumptions. Continue this process until we have enough information to create a comprehensive specification. Only then may you ask to proceed to Step 2. Let's do this iteratively, exploring every relevant detail. Begin with open-ended questions about the core concept. Remember, only one question at a time.

STOP: Do NOT proceed to Step 2 without my acknowledgement!

## Step 2 - Create a specification

After completing the idea exploration step, compile our findings into a comprehensive specification. If @spec.md already exists, update it with the new information and validate the changes. Ensure the document is well-structured, including a short description, all relevant requirements, key decisions, data handling details, potential issues, and a validation plan. Do NOT make any assumptions. ONLY include information we have discussed to ensure accuracy. Save or update the specification in @spec.md.

STOP: Ensure that I am fully satisfied with the spec.md before proceeding! If needed, go back to Step 1 to further explore the idea.
