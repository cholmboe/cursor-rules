# Cursor Rules Creation Guidelines

## File Structure

- Start every file with YAML frontmatter between triple dashes
- Include a clear description in the frontmatter that explains the rules' purpose
- Add relevant glob patterns to specify which files the rules apply to
- Use `.mdc` extension for all rules files
- Place rules files in the appropriate directory structure

## Content Organization

- Begin with an H1 (#) title that clearly states the topic
- Divide content into logical H2 (##) sections
- Order sections from fundamental to advanced concepts
- Keep related rules together within the same section
- Maintain consistent spacing between sections

## Rule Writing Style

- Write each rule as a bullet point using single hyphens
- Start rules with action verbs when possible
- Make rules specific and actionable
- Keep rules concise and focused
- Use consistent punctuation at the end of each rule

## Rule Content Quality

- Ensure each rule provides clear guidance
- Avoid vague or ambiguous statements
- Include both high-level principles and specific details
- Make rules practical and implementable
- Cover both what to do and what to avoid

## Technical Specifications

- Define language-specific rules when necessary
- Include framework-specific guidelines where applicable
- Specify version requirements when relevant
- Reference official documentation where appropriate
- Include code patterns and anti-patterns when helpful

## Documentation Standards

- Use proper markdown formatting
- Maintain consistent indentation
- Include examples for complex rules
- Link to related rule sets when applicable
- Keep formatting consistent across all rule files

## Maintenance Guidelines

- Review and update rules regularly
- Remove outdated guidelines
- Add new best practices as they emerge
- Maintain backwards compatibility when possible
- Version rules appropriately

## Rule Validation

- Verify rules against current best practices
- Test rules in real-world scenarios
- Ensure rules don't conflict with each other
- Validate glob patterns for accuracy
- Check for completeness in coverage

## Collaboration Standards

- Follow consistent naming conventions for files
- Include clear change documentation
- Maintain a changelog when appropriate
- Allow for community contributions
- Provide clear contribution guidelines

## Implementation Guidance

- Include setup instructions when needed
- Specify required tools or dependencies
- Provide migration guidelines for major changes
- Document any required configuration
- Include troubleshooting guidance
